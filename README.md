# Nike-Bot

This project is a bot that I developed with the Python language that 
uses automation to automatically manuever throughout google chrome to 
purchase the the Nike Vapormax. I used the Python selenium library 
along with the Google Chrome Web Driver.

The bot works flawlessly, however, there is room for improvement. For example,
it does not run as fast as I want it to; so I might possibly optimize it. The bot 
works by asking the user for their shipping information, card information, 
and contact information. It then proceeds to open up the url of the Nike Vapormax
on Gogle Chrome and maneavers throughout the webpage to make the purchase
